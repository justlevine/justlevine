<h2 style="border-bottom:0"> I'm a social-preneur, nonprofit founder and consultant, and open-source web developer that specializes in PHP, traditional and Headless <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql">WPGraphQL</a>.</h2>

There's nothing that I enjoy more than solving complex solutions for social good. I believe passionately in the power of community, and  I've been working with and developing tailored web solutions for nonprofits and community-run organizations for almost two decades. It's why I'm an avid proponent of WordPress: clients know it and love it, it's easy to extend and maintain, and the developer community is second to none. Of course, it's no secret that WordPress is legacy code that makes advanced custom work exponentially more difficult with each additional feature - especially when compared to other frameworks.

That's why I fell in love with Headless WP and WPGraphQL. It offers all the benefits of the web's most popular CMS while promising the flexibily of truly custom frontend experiences. The possibilities are endless.

I'm fully committed to Headless WP, and recently founded [AxePress](https://axepress.dev), a web development agency dedicated to expanding the WPGraphQL ecosystem. All our work is open-source, and for every billable hour we donate an additional 25% of our time to contributing to WPGraphQL and its myriad of community-developed plugins.

<h3 align="center">Supporting @AxeWP on GitHub directly supports my ongoing contributions to the WPGraphQL ecosystem.</h3>
